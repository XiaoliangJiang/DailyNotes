Frequently-needed operations or features in Pandas:
  1. Heterogeous data types
  * mutiple data type for a column
  2. Accessing specific columns
    a. by nameing 
    b. by position
  3. Accessing specific rows
    a. by position
    b. by content
  4. Ordering/sorting
  5. Min, max, sum, other statistical things
  6. Other math operations
  7. Grouping
  8. Joining dataframes

* NaN = Not A Number special data type
* VEI = how strong the vocanic
* .shape = dim()
* groupby must have a pair of ()
* .shape does not work on groupby but well on dataframe. Using size instead of .shape
* v.groupby('Year').size().to_frame() = looks fancy
* v[['TD_MIN','TD_MAX','TOTAL_DEATHS','TOTAL_DEATHS_DESCRIPTION']] double [], outer slicing, inter list
* describe()

Possible questions:
* freq of eruptions for each volcano.
* find those now dormant
* look for correlation between VEI and death
* most dangerous volcano by VEI
