    - Team or Along?
    - A supervisor is needed
    
    Dear Jiang,

      Thanks for your interest in the SemEval shared task 12. I will need some more information to register you. For which           institution/company are you working for? If you have a team working with you, you will have to create the team and your       team members will have to join your team during their registration. For more detailed instructions for the "Competition       Team", please see the documentation at https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions/wiki/User_Teams#competition-           teams. Please, create a team even if you intend to work alone. 

      If you are student(s), we require each team to have an academic supervisor to help them conduct their research. The           supervisor does not have to be fully involved, but he or she will provide the guidance needed. Please, be sure that your       supervisor agrees with your participation to the share task and provide me his/her name and email address as well as all       names and emails of your team members.

      Best regards,
      Davy
