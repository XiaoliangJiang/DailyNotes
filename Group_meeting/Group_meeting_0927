Summary of last week:
  1. SemEval shared task:
    - Set-up account on their website
    - Created a team and email the team information to the administrator.
  2. Toponyms in PubMed abstract
    - Followed up your suggestion and trying to use command line to do the searching instead of python.
    - Command line is really fast and robust than Python. It can deal with about 37,600 instances per second on my laptop locally.
    - I have tried zgrep and grep, both of them are much faster than python.
    - I made a place name list for some most ambiguous names of places. Some of them from your MapAffill paper, they are:
      London
      New York
      Boston
      Paris
      Beijing
      Los Angels
      Lebanon
      Washington
    - I also tried some ambiguous words: like 
      Union
      University
  3. I also tried to grep the sentences which contains the keywords.
    P. But even if I used a very loose regular expression, the result still lost some instances.
       [^\.]*Lebanon[^\.]*\.
    Q. Do you have any suggestion?
  4. I found that you mentioned that you have used perl in the MapAffill paper.
    Q. Is that a language that I can do program and create some functions which can run in command line?
  5. Trying to find the neighboors but mannually checked the result, found that:
    1. a small partial of neighboors are the city of Lebanon (Beirut the capital of Lebanon)
    2. a small partial of them are other countries, like US, Brazil.
    3. But most of them are just narrative words.
  6. To do next:
    1. Better Regular expression to get as much information as possinble
    2. Finding more neighboors in other data-set?
    3.
