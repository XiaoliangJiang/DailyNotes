1. Grading:
  1. In last week, I am busy with grading. As what we discussed, I made sample answers for all of the previous assignments. They are assignment 3, assignment 4, assignment 5, and assignment 6. I have uploaded all of them on the Moodle to let the students check their answers before they get feedback from us.
  2. Shriya and I finished the grading on assignment 3 and 4. And we are grading on Assignment 5 right now. I think we can finish it by Friday. And if it is possible, we can also complete the assignment 6 grading work by this weekednd. But it depends on Shriya's time. She has medterms in this week too. But at least, we can finish the grading work on all of previous assignment besides the last homework they uploaded this week.
  3. I will provide two additional office hours in this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon to answer their questions.
2. Research:
  1. Since grading takes me a lot of time, I did not work a lot on it. But I have collected all of the sentences from the PubMed abstracts which contain the keyword "Springfield" and "Madison". If you have time we can check their result later after this meeting.
