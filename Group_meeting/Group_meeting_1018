  1. Setup the baseline of the competition
  - Python scripts for evaluation: 1000+ lines 
  - geonames-services to do the detection and annotation
    This system can do the detection and the disambiguation of the toponyms in raw texts. The disambiguation of all toponyms detected is then performed using a common heuristic, the population heuristic. Using this heuristic, the system always disambiguates a toponym by choosing the place which has the highest population in GeoNames. 
  
  - installed all of the required environment python, java, maven
  - run the eoname-services successfully but failed to get any result...
  - I will try to redo all of the setting steps, since I think it is not a big problem, maybe I just put some data in a wrong place. I will contact the developer for seeking some helps, if I cannot make it by myself.
  
  2. Springfield and Madison results
  - If it is possible, we can test it later after the meeting.
  
  3. TA works
  - grading on the assignment 5 and 6 until Monday morning.
  - provided additional office hours on Monday afternoon and evening.
Just started to work on research from Tuesday evening.
