SELECT * FROM Journals WHERE Title LIKE '%infection%' limit 50\g; 
-> got 33

SELECT a.PMID, a.abstract, t.ISSN FROM Abstracts AS a, Articles AS t, Journals AS j WHERE a.PMID=t.PMID AND j.ISSN=t.ISSN AND j.Title LIKE '%infection%' LIMIT 50\g;

SELECT j.Title, j.ISSN, a.PMID, a.abstract FROM Abstracts AS a, Articles AS t, Journals AS j WHERE a.PMID=t.PMID AND j.ISSN=t.issn AND j.Title LIKE '%infection%' GROUP BY a.PMID LIMIT 50\g;

Final version:
SELECT r.PMID, r.title, r.mesh, r.journal, f.affiliation, f.affiliation2, b.abstract FROM Articles AS r, Abstracts AS b, Affiliations AS f WHERE r.PMID=b.PMID AND b.PMID=f.PMID AND (r.title LIKE '%infection%' OR r.mesh LIKE '%infection%' OR r.journal LIKE '%infection%') GROUP BY r.PMID LIMIT 50\g;

select PMID title mesh term journal name affiliation abstract which contains 'infection' in the title, mesh terms or journal name.
I also got some ideas from your paper about the tropical diseases, I think the article, mesh term or title which includes some word like tropical or cold zone that may indicate a particular area may also contains some information in the abstrats. But I am not an expert in this area. So, I would like to start it with using the infection.

Problem1: 
  - ISSN is not primary key which means that it is not unique and non-empty...
  - solved somehow: using articles abstracts and affiliations instead of journals...
 


Question:
  1. LUI, SUI, PAIRS
  2. MeSH_Sem_Cats
  3. I know MappAffil can return a pair of coordinates to represent the latitude and longitude from the affiliation. But how can I get the coordiates about the place name in Abstract.
  4. http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html
  5. Vincent distance selected. Great-circle distance between two points

Shared Task:
  - they released a weakly labeled corpus.
  - one is for positive (contains some true placename) another one is for negative which may do not contain any place name but some other interference terms.
  - the corpus has two columns, the first column contains each word in a given article, the second colums represent the annotator that whether it is a placename or not. If it is, set it as I-Loc, if not set it as zero. It shows what they did on the previous standard corps they use.
  - But I still trying to run their baseline-code which always returned an error in theri python scripts. I have checked my installationn sevreal times, but I have no idea what happens. So I emailed them agian to seek for some assistance.
