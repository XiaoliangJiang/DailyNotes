What is information?
  - formal methods: (we are doing informal or very informal methods...)
  - eg Susan knows that there is a mouse in the attic.
    1. Susan believe that ...
    2. There is a mouse in the attic.
    3. There is a mouse in the attic is justified for Susan.
    if eg is true, each of the 1, 2, 3 has to be true. (collectively sufficient/collective sufficiency)
    a counter example, eg is true but 1, or 2, or 3 is not true. 
  - eg. S knows that P=df.
    1. S believes P.
    2. P
    3. P is justified for S.
    B(s,p) & P & J(p,s)
    
    1. find an analysis of ...
    2. develop an analysis of ...
    A-B-C, if C-A: equivalent
    A-B-C-D-E, if E-B and E-C: overlap
