How Open Licensing Can Support Reporducibility in Computational Science
victoria Stodden

Communalism: scientific results are the common property of the community
Universalism: all scientists can contribute to science regardless of race,nationality, culture, or gender.
Disinterestedness: act for the benefit of a common scientific enterprise, rather than for personal gain.
Skepticism: eg.listen to me since what I said is make sense

independently verified, transparency

Parsing reproducibility
  - Empirical Reproducibility
  - Statistical reproducibiliy
  - Computational reproducibility

Empirical Reproducibility 
Statistical Reproducibility
  - False discovery, p-hacking, file drawer problem, overuse and mis-use of p-values, lack of multiple testing adjustment.
  - Low powermpoor experimental design, nonrandom sampling
  - data preparation, treatment of outliers,
  - 
  - 

how outliers will be dealt with
sample size estimation for effect size
whether samples are treated randomly
whether experimenter blind to the conduct of the experiment

Modeling and simulation
it is common now to consider  computation as a third branch of science besides theory and experiment.
This book is about a new fourth paradigm for science basd on data-intensive computing

The ubiquity of error
The impact of technology
  - Big data/data driven discovery: high dimentsional data p>>n
  - Computational Power: simulation of the complete evolution of a physical system, systematically varying parameters
  - deep intellectual contributions now encoded only on software.
